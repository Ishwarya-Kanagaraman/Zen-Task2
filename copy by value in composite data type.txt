Copy by value a composite data type.
----------------------------------------------
We can copy a value of composite datatypes using spread operator.
                What changes do we make to our code, so that changes in one array doesn’t affect second array.
We can use the concept of SPREAD OPERATOR ( … ) to overcome this.
To have a better understanding, let’s look at below example.
     let arr1=[1,2,3];
     let arr2=[...arr1];
      arr2.push(4);
      conosle.log(arr1) // prints [1,2,3]
       console.log(arr2) // prints [1,2,3,4]
So, arr2 makes a copy of its own in the form of […arr1].
What […arr1] does here is, it takes in an array arr1 and expands it into individual elements, and again it takes the form of array and gets assigned to arr2.
So, the arr1 doesn’t get altered even after we make changes to array arr2, after the usage of spread operator.
